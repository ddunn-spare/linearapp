## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Consolidated research's 7 phases into 4 (quick depth). Merged infrastructure + approval UX into Phase 1, merged all Linear + OKR actions into Phase 2.
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 but not each other. Ordered sequentially so Linear experience informs GitHub implementation.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (GitHub) has a research flag: GitHub REST API lacks native idempotency keys. Needs investigation during plan-phase.
